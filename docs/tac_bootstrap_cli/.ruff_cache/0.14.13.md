# Overview

This folder contains the routing configuration for the frontend of the Tac Bootstrap CLI.

# Responsibilities

* Handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate handler.
* Manage caching and cache invalidation.

# Key APIs / Components

* `ruff`: The routing framework used by the CLI.
* `cache`: The caching mechanism used by the CLI.

# Invariants & Contracts

* All routes must be registered with the `ruff` framework.
* Caching mechanisms must be properly configured to avoid cache invalidation issues.

# Side Effects & IO

* Reading and writing configuration files.
* Making API requests to external services (e.g. caching services).

# Operational Notes (perf, scaling, failure)

* Optimize routing configuration for performance and scalability.
* Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.

# TODO / Gaps

* Investigate alternative caching mechanisms that do not rely on external services.
