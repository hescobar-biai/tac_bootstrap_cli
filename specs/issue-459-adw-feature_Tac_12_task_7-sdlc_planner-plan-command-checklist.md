# Validation Checklist: Create plan.md command file

**Spec:** `specs/issue-459-adw-feature_Tac_12_task_7-sdlc_planner-plan-command.md`
**Branch:** `feature-issue-459-adw-feature_Tac_12_task_7-create-plan-command`
**Review ID:** `feature_Tac_12_task_7`
**Date:** `2026-01-29`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED (690 passed, 2 skipped)
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.claude/commands/plan.md` exists in the TAC Bootstrap repository
- [x] `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/plan.md.j2` exists and uses `{{ config.paths.specs_dir }}`
- [x] "plan" command is added to scaffold_service.py commands list in alphabetical order
- [x] Command uses claude-opus-4-1-20250805 model
- [x] Command allows only: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, MultiEdit tools
- [x] Command has a simple 5-step workflow (no scout agents)
- [x] Plans are saved to specs/ directory with auto-generated kebab-case filenames
- [x] All validation commands pass with zero regressions

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run mypy tac_bootstrap/
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Review Summary

Successfully implemented the `/plan` command feature that creates simple implementation plans without scout agents. The implementation created three files as specified: base command file (.claude/commands/plan.md), Jinja2 template (plan.md.j2), and updated scaffold_service.py to include the command. All technical validations passed (syntax, types, linting, 690 tests), and all acceptance criteria are met.

## Review Issues

**Issue #1: Commands list not fully alphabetically sorted (tech_debt)**
- Description: The commands list in scaffold_service.py has "plan" placed after "parallel_subagents" as instructed by the spec, but the overall list is not fully alphabetically sorted. The sequence is: parallel_subagents, plan, t_metaprompt_workflow, build_w_report. Full alphabetical order would be: background, build_w_report, load_ai_docs, load_bundle, parallel_subagents, plan, prime_cc, quick-plan, t_metaprompt_workflow.
- Resolution: Consider refactoring the commands list to be fully alphabetically sorted for better maintainability. This would require moving several commands, not just "plan".
- Severity: tech_debt (does not block release but creates technical debt for future maintenance)
