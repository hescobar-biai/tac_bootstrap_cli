# Validation Checklist: /scout Slash Command for Parallel Codebase Exploration

**Spec:** `specs/issue-328-adw-feature_Tac_11_task_3-sdlc_planner-scout-slash-command.md`
**Branch:** `feature-issue-328-adw-feature_Tac_11_task_3-scout-slash-command`
**Review ID:** `feature_Tac_11_task_3`
**Date:** 2026-01-27

## Automated Technical Validations

Since this is a markdown slash command file (not executable Python code), automated technical validations are N/A:
- [N/A] Syntax and type checking - Not applicable (markdown template)
- [N/A] Linting - Not applicable (markdown template)
- [N/A] Unit tests - Not applicable (markdown template)
- [N/A] Application smoke test - Not applicable (markdown template)

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Command Creation
- [x] File `.claude/commands/scout.md` exists
- [x] Command follows standard slash command format with Variables, Instructions, Workflow, Report sections

### 2. Functionality
- [x] Command accepts USER_PROMPT as required parameter
- [x] Command accepts optional SCALE parameter (defaults to 4)
- [x] Command launches SCALE number of Task agents with Explore subagent_type in parallel (single message)
- [x] Each agent uses distinct exploration strategy

### 3. Output Generation
- [x] Output directory `agents/scout_files/` is created automatically
- [x] Output file is named `relevant_files_{timestamp}.md` with timestamp format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- [x] Output markdown contains all required sections:
  - [x] Search summary
  - [x] Per-strategy results
  - [x] Aggregated file list with frequency counts
  - [x] Recommendations

### 4. User Experience
- [x] Command provides progress feedback during execution
- [x] Command reports completion with summary
- [x] Output is human-readable and actionable

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Command includes usage examples
- [x] Command includes notes on SCALE recommendations
- [x] CLAUDE.md is updated to list the new command

### 6. Robustness
- [x] Handles missing USER_PROMPT gracefully
- [x] Handles invalid SCALE values gracefully
- [x] Handles partial agent failures (some agents fail, others succeed)
- [x] Handles no files found scenario

## Validation Commands Executed

Since this is a slash command template (not executable code), validation is manual:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - ✅ Verified `.claude/commands/scout.md` exists (509 lines)
   - ✅ Confirmed all required sections present (Variables, Instructions, Workflow, Report, Examples, Notes)
   - ✅ Verified variables defined correctly (USER_PROMPT=$1 required, SCALE=$2 default=4)
   - ✅ Verified 4 distinct strategies (File Patterns, Content Search, Architecture, Dependencies)
   - ✅ Verified parallel execution instructions (single message with multiple Task calls)
   - ✅ Verified output format includes all required sections
   - ✅ Verified edge case handling documented

2. **Code Quality**
   - ✅ All required sections are present
   - ✅ Instructions are clear and actionable
   - ✅ Examples are helpful and cover multiple use cases
   - ✅ Notes section includes performance considerations and best practices

3. **Integration Check**
   - ✅ Command is listed in CLAUDE.md under "Comandos Disponibles"
   - ✅ Command follows patterns from parallel_subagents.md
   - ✅ No conflicts with existing commands

## Review Summary

Implementation successfully delivers a comprehensive `/scout` slash command for parallel codebase exploration. The command follows established patterns from `/parallel_subagents`, implements all acceptance criteria, and provides extensive documentation including usage examples, performance notes, and troubleshooting guidance. The command uses Claude Code's Task tool with Explore subagent_type to launch multiple parallel exploration agents with distinct strategies (file patterns, content search, architectural analysis, dependency mapping), aggregates results with frequency-based relevance scoring, and generates a structured markdown report. CLAUDE.md has been updated to document the new command. No blocking issues found.

## Review Issues

None - implementation is complete and meets all acceptance criteria.
