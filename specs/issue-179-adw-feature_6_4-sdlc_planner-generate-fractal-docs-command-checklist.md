- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Template file exists at `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/generate_fractal_docs.md.j2`
- [x] Rendered file exists at `.claude/commands/generate_fractal_docs.md`

- [x] Command is invocable as `/generate_fractal_docs` in Claude Code
- [x] SCOPE argument works (both "full" and "changed")
- [x] Prerequisite check validates script existence
- [x] Error handling prevents committing failed generation
- [x] Smart commit only commits when changes exist

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run mypy tac_bootstrap/
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Review Summary

The implementation successfully creates a Claude Code slash command template for generating fractal documentation. Both the Jinja2 template (`generate_fractal_docs.md.j2`) and the rendered command file (`generate_fractal_docs.md`) were created according to spec. The command provides prerequisite validation, conditional SCOPE-based execution, error handling, and intelligent commit behavior. All automated technical validations passed with 660 tests passing, zero linting issues, successful type checking, and a working CLI smoke test.

## Review Issues

No blocking issues found. The implementation is complete and ready for release.
