# Validation Checklist: Create Pydantic Configuration Models

**Spec:** `specs/issue-5-adw-e80a5f17-sdlc_planner-create-pydantic-config-models.md`
**Branch:** `chore-issue-6-adw-c0c91505-create-pydantic-config-models`
**Review ID:** `c0c91505`
**Date:** `2026-01-27`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

The spec file does not contain an explicit "## Acceptance Criteria" section with checkboxes. However, based on the implementation requirements in the spec, the following acceptance criteria have been validated:

- [x] All enums created (Language, Framework, Architecture, PackageManager, ProjectMode, AgenticProvider, RunIdStrategy, DefaultWorkflow)
- [x] All sub-models created (ProjectSpec, PathsSpec, CommandsSpec, WorktreeConfig, LoggingConfig, SafetyConfig, AgenticSpec, ClaudeSettings, ClaudeCommandsConfig, ClaudeConfig, TemplatesConfig, BootstrapConfig)
- [x] TACConfig root model created with version field and extra="forbid"
- [x] ProjectSpec.name validator sanitizes project names (strips, lowercase, replaces spaces)
- [x] Helper functions implemented (get_frameworks_for_language, get_package_managers_for_language, get_default_commands)
- [x] Models can be imported successfully
- [x] Models can be instantiated and serialized to JSON
- [x] All fields use Field() with comprehensive descriptions
- [x] Models align with config.yml structure

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run python -m py_compile tac_bootstrap/**/*.py

cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run python -c "from tac_bootstrap.domain.models import TACConfig; print('OK')"
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run python -c "from tac_bootstrap.domain.models import *; config = TACConfig(project=ProjectSpec(name='test', language=Language.PYTHON, package_manager=PackageManager.UV), commands=CommandsSpec(start='uv run python -m app', test='uv run pytest'), claude=ClaudeConfig(settings=ClaudeSettings(project_name='test'))); print(config.model_dump_json(indent=2))"
```

## Review Summary

The branch chore-issue-6-adw-c0c91505-create-pydantic-config-models contains only MCP configuration path updates (from ac5b5582 to c0c91505). The Pydantic models referenced in the spec file (issue-5) were already implemented in a previous commit and are fully functional. All validation tests pass: syntax checks, type checking, linting, unit tests (690 passed, 2 skipped), and CLI smoke tests all succeed. The models.py file contains complete implementations of all required enums, sub-models, the TACConfig root model, and helper functions as specified.

## Review Issues

### Issue 1 (skippable)
**Description:** Branch name mismatch: The current branch is 'chore-issue-6-adw-c0c91505' but the spec file provided is 'issue-5-adw-e80a5f17'. The changes in this branch only update MCP config paths and do not implement the models described in the spec.

**Resolution:** The Pydantic models described in issue-5 spec were already implemented in a previous commit and exist in the codebase. This branch (issue-6) appears to be a follow-up chore that updates configuration paths. No action needed as models are complete and functional.

### Issue 2 (skippable)
**Description:** The git diff shows only 2 files changed (.mcp.json and playwright-mcp-config.json) with path updates, which does not align with the spec requirement to create models.py.

**Resolution:** The models.py file was created in a previous implementation (likely merged from the issue-5 branch). This review validates that the existing models.py implementation meets all requirements from the spec. The current branch is a maintenance chore updating config paths for worktree c0c91505.
