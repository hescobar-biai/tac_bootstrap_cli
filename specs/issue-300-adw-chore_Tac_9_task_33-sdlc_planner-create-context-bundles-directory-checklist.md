# Validation Checklist: Create agents/context_bundles directory in root

**Spec:** `specs/issue-300-adw-chore_Tac_9_task_33-sdlc_planner-create-context-bundles-directory.md`
**Branch:** `chore-issue-300-adw-chore_Tac_9_task_33-create-context-bundles-directory`
**Review ID:** `chore_Tac_9_task_33`
**Date:** `2026-01-26`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED (683 passed, 2 skipped)
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

The spec file did not contain explicit "## Acceptance Criteria" section with checkboxes, but based on the implementation requirements:

- [x] `agents/` directory exists
- [x] `agents/context_bundles/` subdirectory exists
- [x] `.gitkeep` file exists in `agents/context_bundles/`
- [x] Directory is tracked by git
- [x] `.gitignore` updated to allow tracking of `agents/context_bundles/` while excluding other `agents/*` directories
- [x] No regressions in test suite
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] CLI smoke test passes

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
ls -la agents/context_bundles/
```

## Review Summary

The implementation successfully created the `agents/context_bundles/` directory infrastructure as specified. The directory structure was created with a `.gitkeep` file to ensure git tracking. The `.gitignore` file was properly updated to exclude `agents/*` while explicitly allowing the `agents/context_bundles/` directory. All tests passed (683 passed, 2 skipped), linting passed with zero errors, and the CLI smoke test confirmed the application remains functional. The directory is properly tracked by git and ready to store context bundle JSONL files at runtime.

## Review Issues

No issues found. Implementation is complete and ready to merge.
