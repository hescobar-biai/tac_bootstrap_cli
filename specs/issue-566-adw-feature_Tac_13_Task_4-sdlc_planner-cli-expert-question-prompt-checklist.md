**Review ID:** `feature_Tac_13_Task_4`
**Date:** `2026-02-02`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED (716 passed, 2 skipped)
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Jinja2 template created at correct path with valid syntax
- [x] Template uses `{{ config.project.name }}` variable appropriately
- [x] Template registered in `scaffold_service.py` with correct action and reason
- [x] Implementation file created in repo root with hardcoded values
- [x] Implementation file ready for immediate use (executable via `/experts/cli/question`)
- [x] YAML frontmatter valid in both template and implementation
- [x] Workflow has 3 phases: Read Expertise → Validate → Report
- [x] Report format section provides clear structured output template
- [x] Example execution demonstrates expected usage and output
- [x] All validation commands pass (pytest, ruff, mypy, CLI smoke test)

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
# 1. Verify template file exists and has valid Jinja2 syntax
test -f tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/experts/cli/question.md.j2 && echo "✓ Template exists"

# 2. Verify implementation file exists
test -f .claude/commands/experts/cli/question.md && echo "✓ Implementation exists"

# 3. Check YAML frontmatter is valid (implementation file)
head -20 .claude/commands/experts/cli/question.md | grep -A 10 "^---$" | python3 -c "import yaml, sys; yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin)" && echo "✓ YAML valid"

# 4. Verify template registration in scaffold_service.py
grep -q "claude/commands/experts/cli/question.md.j2" tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/application/scaffold_service.py && echo "✓ Template registered"

# 5. Run unit tests
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# 6. Run linting
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .

# 7. Run type checking
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run mypy tac_bootstrap/

# 8. Smoke test CLI
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Review Summary

Successfully implemented the CLI Expert Question Prompt following the TAC-13 dual strategy pattern. Both the Jinja2 template for CLI generation and the implementation file for immediate use in the tac_bootstrap repository have been created with complete functionality. The prompt implements a 3-phase workflow (Read Expertise → Validate → Report) that enables read-only interrogation of the CLI expert's mental model. All acceptance criteria met, all validation commands passed with zero regressions.

## Review Issues

No blocking issues found. Implementation is complete and ready for merge.
