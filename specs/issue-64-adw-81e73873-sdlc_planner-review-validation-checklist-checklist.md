## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Extracted from spec file "## Acceptance Criteria" section -->
- [ ] `/review` command generates validation checklist from spec file
- [ ] Checklist includes all items from spec's "Acceptance Criteria" section
- [ ] Checklist includes automated technical validations (syntax, linting, tests, smoke)
- [ ] Checklist maps `validation_results` (passed/failed) to checkbox states
- [ ] Checklist saved as `<spec_file>-checklist.md` in same directory as spec
- [ ] Checklist format is GitHub markdown compatible (renders correctly in PR comments)
- [ ] Checklist includes review summary and issues from JSON output
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained - JSON output still generated
- [ ] Template documentation updated with checklist generation instructions
- [ ] Manual testing confirms checklist works with existing spec files

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
```

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run mypy tac_bootstrap/

```

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap scaffold --help
```

## Review Summary

The implementation successfully extends the `/review` command template to generate validation checklists from spec files. The enhanced `review.md.j2` template now includes comprehensive instructions for parsing spec files, extracting acceptance criteria, mapping validation results to checklist items, and generating GitHub-compatible markdown. All automated technical validations passed, and the template changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing JSON output format.

## Review Issues

**Issue #1**: Prepare app template changes (tech_debt)
- **Description**: The `prepare_app.md.j2` template was modified with Django-specific enhancements and build steps, which were not part of the spec requirements.
- **Resolution**: These changes appear to be quality improvements but should ideally be in a separate commit or spec. They don't block this feature but create scope creep.
- **Severity**: tech_debt

**Issue #2**: Scaffold service formatting changes (skippable)
- **Description**: The `scaffold_service.py` file has formatting changes (line breaks in array literals) that are pure style improvements unrelated to the feature.
- **Resolution**: These formatting changes don't affect functionality but add noise to the diff. Consider using a code formatter consistently.
- **Severity**: skippable

**Issue #3**: Gitignore additions (skippable)
- **Description**: The `.gitignore` file received significant additions that weren't mentioned in the spec.
- **Resolution**: While these are useful additions, they're out of scope for this feature. Consider moving to a separate commit.
- **Severity**: skippable
