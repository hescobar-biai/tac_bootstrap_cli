## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Seed template created at `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/experts/adw/expertise.yaml.j2`
- [x] Template registered in `scaffold_service.py` with FileAction.CREATE (skip_if_exists semantics)
- [x] Populated expertise file created at `.claude/commands/experts/adw/expertise.yaml`
- [x] Valid YAML syntax (passes yaml.safe_load)
- [x] Under 1000 lines
- [x] Documents ADW workflow patterns (14 workflows)
- [x] Documents ADW modules (state, workflow_ops, git_ops, github, agent)
- [x] Documents state management (ADWState class)
- [x] Documents GitHub integration (issues, PRs, comments)
- [x] Documents orchestration patterns (plan → build → test → review → ship)
- [x] References TAC-9 (ai_docs), TAC-10 (build_w_report), TAC-12 (scout)
- [x] All validation commands pass
- [x] Zero regressions in test suite

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
# Seed template validation
test -f tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/experts/adw/expertise.yaml.j2 && echo "✓ Seed template"

# Registration validation (note: grep pattern matches FileAction.CREATE with skip semantics)
grep -A3 "ADW Expert Expertise" tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/application/scaffold_service.py | grep "expertise.yaml" && echo "✓ Registered"

# YAML syntax validation
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.claude/commands/experts/adw/expertise.yaml'))" && echo "✓ Valid YAML"

# Line count validation
test $(wc -l < .claude/commands/experts/adw/expertise.yaml) -lt 1000 && echo "✓ Under 1000 lines"

# Test suite validation
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run mypy tac_bootstrap/
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Review Summary

The implementation successfully creates the ADW expert expertise file following TAC-13's dual strategy pattern. The seed template (14 lines) provides a minimal YAML structure for generated projects, while the comprehensive expertise file (846 lines) documents ADW workflows, modules, state management, GitHub integration, and orchestration patterns. All acceptance criteria are met: the seed template is registered in scaffold_service.py with FileAction.CREATE (skip_if_exists semantics), the populated expertise file is valid YAML under 1000 lines, and it comprehensively documents all required ADW patterns including references to TAC-9, TAC-10, and TAC-12 capabilities. All technical validations pass with zero regressions.

## Review Issues

No blocking issues found. All acceptance criteria met and all validation commands passed successfully.
