## Chore Description
The root `adws/adw_modules/github.py` file already contains three user validation functions that are missing from the Jinja2 template. This creates inconsistency between the actual working code and what gets generated for new projects. The template needs to be synchronized to include these three functions:

1. `get_current_gh_user()` - Gets the authenticated GitHub user login by calling `gh api user`
2. `is_issue_assigned_to_me()` - Checks if a specific issue is assigned to the current authenticated user
3. `assign_issue_to_me()` - Assigns a GitHub issue to the current authenticated user using `@me`

These functions are already implemented and tested in the root file (lines 290-387), and need to be added to the template to ensure new projects generated by tac-bootstrap have the same capabilities.

## Relevant Files
Files for completing the chore:

- **`adws/adw_modules/github.py`** (lines 290-387) - SOURCE file containing the three functions to copy. Read-only reference.
- **`tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/adws/adw_modules/github.py.j2`** - TARGET template file to update with the three new functions.

### New Files
No new files required. This is a template synchronization task.

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute each step in order.

### Task 1: Read the template file
- Read `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/adws/adw_modules/github.py.j2` to understand current structure
- Identify where to insert the three new functions (they should go after `fetch_issue_comments` and before `find_keyword_from_comment` to match the source file order)

### Task 2: Add the three user validation functions to the template
- Copy the three functions from `adws/adw_modules/github.py` (lines 290-387):
  - `get_current_gh_user()` (lines 290-308)
  - `is_issue_assigned_to_me()` (lines 311-351)
  - `assign_issue_to_me()` (lines 354-387)
- Insert them in the template at the correct location (after `fetch_issue_comments`, before `find_keyword_from_comment`)
- Ensure formatting and indentation match the template style
- Preserve all docstrings, type hints, and comments

### Task 3: Verify template syntax
- Check that the template file is valid Jinja2 (no template variables needed for these functions)
- Ensure no accidental template syntax was introduced
- Verify the functions are plain Python code (these functions don't require Jinja2 templating)

### Task 4: Run validation commands
- Execute all validation commands to ensure no regressions
- Verify template can be rendered correctly
- Ensure tests pass

## Validation Commands
Execute all commands to validate with zero regressions:

- `cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` - Unit tests
- `cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .` - Linting
- `cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help` - Smoke test

## Notes
- The three functions are already implemented and working in the root `github.py` file
- No modifications to logic are needed, just copy the functions as-is to the template
- The template file is a Jinja2 template (`.j2` extension), but these specific functions don't require any template variables
- Maintain exact same order as in source file for consistency
- This ensures new projects generated by tac-bootstrap have user validation capabilities from the start
