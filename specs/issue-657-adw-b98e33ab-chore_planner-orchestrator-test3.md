# Chore: Add Test 3 to README (Issue #657)

## Metadata
- **issue_number**: 657
- **adw_id**: b98e33ab
- **status**: RESOLVED (No Action Required)

## Chore Description

GitHub Issue #657 requested adding "test 3" documentation to the final section of README.md. However, comprehensive "Orchestrator Test 3" documentation already exists in the README at lines 422-497.

The existing section includes:
- Test validation criteria (database persistence, multi-agent workflows, WebSocket streaming, session management, cost tracking)
- Complete running instructions
- Verification steps with detailed checklist
- Example conversation flow
- Architecture overview with backend/frontend components
- Implementation and schema references

## Resolution

**No changes required.** The requested content already exists in the README and is comprehensive.

## Relevant Files
- `README.md` - Contains complete "Orchestrator Test 3" section (lines 422-497)

## Validation
The issue appears to be either:
1. A duplicate request of existing documentation
2. A misunderstanding that the section wasn't present
3. A request for additional clarity or examples (requires clarification with issue author)

## Next Steps
- Close issue #657 as "resolved" or "not needed"
- If additional clarity on Test 3 is needed, create a new focused issue with specific requirements
