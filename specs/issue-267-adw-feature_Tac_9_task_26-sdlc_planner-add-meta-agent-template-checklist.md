## Review Summary

The meta-agent.md.j2 template has been successfully implemented with all required components: YAML frontmatter with proper agent metadata, comprehensive Purpose section, detailed 10-step Workflow, and Output Format section. The template follows the established pattern from docs-scraper.md.j2 and meets all acceptance criteria. All validation commands pass with 677 tests passing, zero regressions, clean linting, and successful type checking.

## Review Issues

### Issue #1 - Skippable
**Description:** Template does not use {{ config.project.name }} Jinja2 variable like docs-scraper.md.j2 does. While the spec mentions using this variable 'where project name is referenced', the meta-agent template doesn't reference the project name anywhere in its content, so this may be intentional. However, consistency with docs-scraper pattern suggests it could be added to the Purpose or description section.

**Resolution:** Consider adding {{ config.project.name }} reference in the Purpose section for consistency, e.g., 'You will create agents for the {{ config.project.name }} project.' This is optional since the meta-agent functionality is project-agnostic.

**Severity:** skippable
