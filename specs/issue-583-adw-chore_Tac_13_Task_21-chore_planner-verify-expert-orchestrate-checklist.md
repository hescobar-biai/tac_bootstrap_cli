# Validation Checklist: Verify expert-orchestrate template

**Spec:** `specs/issue-583-adw-chore_Tac_13_Task_21-chore_planner-verify-expert-orchestrate.md`
**Branch:** `chore-issue-583-adw-chore_Tac_13_Task_21-verify-expert-orchestrate-template`
**Review ID:** `chore_Tac_13_Task_21`
**Date:** `2026-02-03`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED (All checks passed!)
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED (716 passed, 2 skipped in 5.26s)
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED (CLI help displays correctly)

## Acceptance Criteria

Note: This spec does not explicitly list acceptance criteria in a "## Acceptance Criteria" section. Based on the spec content, the implicit acceptance criteria are:

- [x] Template file exists at correct location
- [x] Template is registered in `scaffold_service.py`
- [x] Template uses correct Jinja2 syntax with `{{ config }}` variables
- [x] Template contains proper orchestration workflow instructions (Plan → Build → Improve)
- [x] Template has 7 main steps: validation, todo init, plan, build, self-improve, report, final status
- [x] All validation commands pass with zero regressions

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
test -f tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/expert-orchestrate.md.j2 && echo "✓ Template exists"
grep -n "expert-orchestrate" tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/application/scaffold_service.py
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Review Summary

This is a verification-only task (Task 21) that confirms the expert-orchestrate template was properly created in Task 16. The review validated that: (1) the Jinja2 template exists at the correct location with 301 lines of content, (2) the template is registered in scaffold_service.py at line 345, (3) the template uses correct Jinja2 syntax with `{{ config.project.name }}` variables, and (4) the template contains the complete orchestration workflow with all 7 required steps. All automated validations passed: tests (716 passed), linting (all checks passed), and smoke test (CLI functional). No new code was written as this task only verified existing implementation from Task 16. The dual strategy pattern is confirmed with template, registration, and seed file all present and functional.

## Review Issues

No issues found. All validation checks passed successfully.
