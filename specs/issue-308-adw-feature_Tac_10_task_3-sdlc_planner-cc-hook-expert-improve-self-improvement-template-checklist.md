## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

## Review Summary

The implementation successfully updates the cc_hook_expert_improve template to implement a manual-trigger, report-only workflow for expert self-improvement. Both the Jinja2 template (.j2) and the rendered markdown (.md) file have been updated with the new 5-phase workflow: Establish Expertise, Analyze Recent Changes (using `git log -5 --stat`), Determine Relevance (path-based filtering), Extract and Apply Learnings (report generation only), and Report (structured markdown output). The template properly uses Jinja2 variables for portability, removes the Edit tool from allowed-tools, implements early return logic for non-matching files, and includes comprehensive documentation on when/how to use the command. All tests pass with zero regressions.

## Review Issues

No blocking issues found. The implementation fully meets all acceptance criteria specified in the spec.
