**Spec:** `specs/issue-579-adw-feature_Tac_13_Task_17-sdlc_planner-parallel-expert-scaling.md`
**Branch:** `feature-issue-579-adw-feature_Tac_13_Task_17-parallel-expert-scaling`
**Review ID:** `feature_Tac_13_Task_17`
**Date:** `2026-02-03`

## Automated Technical Validations

- [x] Syntax and type checking - PASSED
- [x] Linting - PASSED
- [x] Unit tests - PASSED (716 passed, 2 skipped)
- [x] Application smoke test - PASSED

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Template file created: `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/expert-parallel.md.j2`
- [x] Template uses Jinja2 variables (e.g., `{{ config.project.name }}`)
- [x] Template registered in scaffold_service.py (added to commands list around line 345)
- [x] Implementation file exists: `.claude/commands/expert-parallel.md`
- [x] Command has proper frontmatter (allowed-tools, description, argument-hint, model)
- [x] Variables defined: EXPERT_DOMAIN ($1), TASK ($2), NUM_AGENTS ($3, default: 3)
- [x] Phase 1 validates inputs: domain non-empty, task non-empty, num_agents in 3-10 range
- [x] Phase 2 spawns 3-10 agents in parallel using single message with multiple Task invocations
- [x] Phase 3 monitors with blocking wait and progress updates
- [x] Phase 4 synthesis uses opus model explicitly
- [x] Synthesis produces markdown report with sections: Consensus, Conflicts, Recommendations
- [x] Partial failure handling: continues with ≥2 successful agents
- [x] Full agent outputs stored in scratchpad and linked in report
- [x] Clear error messages for validation failures and insufficient successes
- [x] All validation commands pass with zero regressions

## Validation Commands Executed

```bash
# Verify files exist
test -f tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/expert-parallel.md.j2 && echo "✓ Template"
grep "expert-parallel" tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/application/scaffold_service.py && echo "✓ Registered"
test -f .claude/commands/expert-parallel.md && echo "✓ Repo file"

# Run test suite
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Run linting

```

## Review Summary

The `/expert-parallel` command has been successfully implemented following the TAC-13 parallel expert consensus pattern. The implementation includes a comprehensive 4-phase workflow (validation, spawn, monitor, synthesis) that spawns 3-10 independent expert agents to analyze the same task, then uses an opus-powered synthesis agent to aggregate outputs and identify consensus patterns, conflicts, and recommendations. Both the working implementation (.claude/commands/expert-parallel.md) and the Jinja2 template (tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/claude/commands/expert-parallel.md.j2) have been created and registered in scaffold_service.py. The command includes robust input validation, partial failure tolerance (minimum 2 successful agents), transparent output storage in scratchpad, and clear error messaging. All automated validations pass with zero regressions.

## Review Issues

No blocking issues identified. The implementation fully meets all acceptance criteria.
