## Review Summary

A Jinja2 template for the `/load_bundle` command was successfully created following the `/background` command pattern. The template includes all required sections (Variables, Instructions, Run, Examples, Report) and provides comprehensive guidance for loading and restoring context from JSONL bundle files. The rendered example at `.claude/commands/load_bundle.md` is properly formatted. All automated validation checks (tests, linting, type checking, CLI smoke test) pass successfully with zero regressions. However, the template currently does not use any Jinja2 configuration variables (like `{{ config.project.name }}`), which is a minor technical debt issue that should be addressed for consistency with other command templates.

## Review Issues

1. **Issue #1**: Template does not use Jinja2 config variables
   - **Description**: The template file `load_bundle.md.j2` is essentially static and does not leverage any Jinja2 variables like `{{ config.project.name }}` or other configuration values. While the spec mentions using Jinja2 variables appropriately (Acceptance Criterion #8), the current implementation does not include any dynamic configuration interpolation.
   - **Resolution**: Consider adding project-specific context where appropriate, such as: mentioning the project name in the header/instructions, using `{{ config.project.logging_dir }}` if available for bundle storage paths, or other relevant configuration values. This would make the template more adaptive to different project configurations.
   - **Severity**: tech_debt
