# Update SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP Template

**ADW ID:** chore_Tac_11_task_15
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Specification:** specs/issue-344-adw-chore_Tac_11_task_15-update-slash-command-model-map.md

## Overview

Updated the agent.py.j2 Jinja2 template to include TAC-11 slash commands (`/scout` and `/question`) in the SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP dictionary. This ensures that projects generated by TAC Bootstrap CLI will have the latest command configurations with proper model mappings.

## What Was Built

- Added `/scout` command mapping to SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP template
- Added `/question` command mapping to SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP template
- Mirrored changes from the reference implementation in main codebase

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/adws/adw_modules/agent.py.j2`: Added TAC-11 slash command entries to SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP dictionary

### Key Changes

- Added `/scout` command with `{"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"}` model mapping for codebase exploration
- Added `/question` command with `{"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"}` model mapping for clarification workflows
- Included descriptive comments to indicate these are TAC-11 exploration and clarification commands
- Both commands use lightweight "sonnet" model for base and heavy configurations
- Changes were placed at the end of the SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP dictionary, maintaining alphabetical ordering by TAC phase

## How to Use

1. The template changes are automatically applied when generating new projects with TAC Bootstrap CLI
2. Existing projects can regenerate their agent.py file or manually apply the changes
3. The updated SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP ensures proper model selection when using `/scout` and `/question` commands in generated projects

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The changes are static additions to the SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP dictionary in the template.

## Testing

Validate that the template changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

Check code quality with linting:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
```

Verify CLI functionality with smoke test:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Notes

- This is a template synchronization task that mirrors changes already implemented in the main codebase
- The reference implementation exists in `adws/adw_modules/agent.py`
- Both `/scout` and `/question` are designed as lightweight commands, hence the "sonnet" model for both base and heavy sets
- Future TAC phases will likely add more slash commands following this same pattern
