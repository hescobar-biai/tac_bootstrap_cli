# Scout Files Directory Template

**ADW ID:** chore_Tac_11_task_12_v2
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Specification:** specs/issue-343-adw-chore_Tac_11_task_12_v2-sdlc_planner-create-scout-files-directory.md

## Overview

Added a template for the `scout_files` directory that will be generated in new projects created by TAC Bootstrap CLI. This directory stores files generated by the `/scout` command during codebase exploration, following the same pattern as existing agent directories.

## What Was Built

- Created `scout_files` directory template in the agents structure
- Added empty `.gitkeep.j2` template to ensure directory creation during project generation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/structure/agents/scout_files/.gitkeep.j2`: New empty template file (0 bytes)
- `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/adws/adw_modules/agent.py.j2`: Removed `/scout` and `/question` entries from SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP (cleanup)

### Key Changes

- Created new `scout_files/` subdirectory under `templates/structure/agents/`
- Added empty `.gitkeep.j2` Jinja2 template following existing pattern (security_logs, hook_logs, context_bundles)
- Ensures directory is tracked in git and created during project generation
- Cleaned up redundant `/scout` and `/question` command entries from agent.py.j2

## How to Use

This is a template-level change that affects projects generated by TAC Bootstrap CLI:

1. Generate a new project using TAC Bootstrap CLI:
```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap init <project-name>
```

2. The generated project will include the `agents/scout_files/` directory structure automatically

3. When using the `/scout` command in the generated project, exploration files will be stored in this directory

## Configuration

No configuration required. The directory is automatically created during project generation as part of the standard agents directory structure.

## Testing

Verify the template is correctly installed:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

Run unit tests to ensure zero regressions:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

Verify code quality:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
```

## Notes

- The `.gitkeep.j2` file is intentionally empty (0 bytes) to match the pattern of other agent directories
- This directory stores markdown files generated by the `/scout` command
- Part of TAC-11 implementation for enhanced codebase exploration capabilities
- No code logic changes required, only template structure addition
