# Security Logs Directory Template

**ADW ID:** chore_Tac_11_task_10_v2
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Specification:** specs/issue-351-adw-chore_Tac_11_task_10_v2-sdlc_planner-create-security-logs-directory.md

## Overview

Created the security_logs directory template structure for generated projects. This directory will store security-related logs in projects created by the TAC Bootstrap CLI, following the same pattern as existing agent subdirectories like context_bundles and hook_logs.

## What Was Built

- New directory template: `security_logs/` under agents structure
- Empty `.gitkeep.j2` template file to ensure directory creation in generated projects
- Consistent pattern with existing agent subdirectories

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/structure/agents/security_logs/.gitkeep.j2`: New empty template file created

### Key Changes

- Created new `security_logs/` subdirectory in the agents template structure
- Added empty `.gitkeep.j2` file to ensure the directory is tracked in git and created when projects are generated
- Follows existing patterns from `context_bundles/.gitkeep.j2` and `hook_logs/.gitkeep.j2` templates
- No code changes required - purely structural addition to template hierarchy

## How to Use

When generating a new project with TAC Bootstrap CLI, the security_logs directory will be automatically created:

1. Run the TAC Bootstrap CLI to generate a new project:
```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli
uv run tac-bootstrap generate <project-name>
```

2. The generated project will include the directory structure:
```
<project-name>/
└── agents/
    ├── context_bundles/
    ├── hook_logs/
    └── security_logs/  # ← New directory
```

3. Security-related logs can now be stored in the `agents/security_logs/` directory of generated projects

## Configuration

No configuration required. The directory is automatically included in all projects generated by the TAC Bootstrap CLI.

## Testing

Verify the template structure exists:

```bash
ls -la tac_bootstrap_cli/tac_bootstrap/templates/structure/agents/security_logs/
```

Run unit tests to ensure no regressions:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

Run linting checks:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
```

Smoke test the CLI:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Notes

- This is a structural chore that extends the template hierarchy without modifying existing code
- The security_logs directory provides a standardized location for security-related logs in generated projects
- The `.gitkeep.j2` pattern ensures empty directories are tracked in version control
- Future enhancements could include default logging configuration or security monitoring scripts
