# Scout Files Directory Structure

**ADW ID:** chore_Tac_11_task_11
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Specification:** specs/issue-342-adw-chore_Tac_11_task_11-sdlc_planner-create-scout-files-directory.md

## Overview

Created the `agents/scout_files/` directory structure to provide a dedicated location for storing output files generated by the `/scout` command. This infrastructure change enables organized storage and version control of codebase exploration results.

## What Was Built

- Created `agents/` parent directory structure
- Created `agents/scout_files/` subdirectory for scout command outputs
- Added `.gitkeep` file to preserve empty directory in version control

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

- `agents/scout_files/.gitkeep`: Empty marker file that ensures the directory is tracked by git even when no scout output files exist
- `.gitignore`: Verified configuration to ensure directory structure is preserved while allowing scout output files

### Key Changes

- Established standardized location for `/scout` command output storage
- Used `.gitkeep` convention to preserve empty directories in git repositories
- Ensured proper git tracking without blocking future scout output files
- Created reusable infrastructure pattern for agent output organization

## How to Use

1. The directory is automatically available after checkout
2. When `/scout` command executes, output files will be stored in `agents/scout_files/`
3. The directory structure is preserved in version control even when empty
4. Scout output files can be gitignored or tracked based on project needs

## Configuration

No configuration is required. The directory structure is created at the repository level and available immediately.

To customize `.gitignore` handling of scout files:
- Edit `.gitignore` to add patterns for `agents/scout_files/*`
- Keep `.gitkeep` always tracked: `!agents/scout_files/.gitkeep`

## Testing

Verify directory structure exists:

```bash
ls -la agents/scout_files/
```

Expected output should show the `.gitkeep` file.

Check git tracking status:

```bash
git status agents/scout_files/
```

The directory and `.gitkeep` file should be tracked by git.

Run validation suite:

```bash
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run ruff check .
cd tac_bootstrap_cli && uv run tac-bootstrap --help
```

## Notes

- This is an infrastructure-level change with no code modifications
- The `.gitkeep` file is a convention used to preserve empty directories in git (which normally doesn't track empty directories)
- The directory will be populated by the `/scout` command during codebase exploration tasks
- This pattern can be extended to other agent output directories as needed (e.g., `agents/plan_files/`, `agents/review_files/`)
- The implementation was completed in commit 345b7d4 and merged to main branch
