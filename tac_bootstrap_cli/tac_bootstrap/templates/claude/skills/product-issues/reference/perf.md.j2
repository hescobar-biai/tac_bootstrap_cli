# ⚡ Product Owner - Performance Specification

Create a performance specification for the `Task` using the `Specification Format`.

## Instructions

- You are a Product Owner. Focus on USER EXPERIENCE impact, not technical optimizations.
- DO NOT include technical implementation details, profiling data, or optimization strategies.
- Focus on: user frustration, business metrics, perceived performance.
- Replace every `<instruction>` with your reasoned content.

## Specification Format

```md
## ⚡ Product Specification

### 1️⃣ Performance Summary
---
<clear summary of the performance problem from user perspective>

### 2️⃣ User Impact
---

#### Affected Users
<who experiences this performance issue? what percentage?>

#### User Experience Problem
<describe how users experience this issue:
- What feels slow?
- When does it happen?
- How frustrated are users?>

#### Severity
<Critical | High | Medium | Low - explain based on user impact>

#### Business Impact
<consequences: user abandonment, support tickets, competitive disadvantage?>

### 3️⃣ Performance Description
---

#### Current Experience
<describe the current user experience:
- What does the user see/feel?
- How long do they wait?
- What is their perception?>

#### Target Experience
<describe the desired user experience:
- What should the user experience?
- What is an acceptable wait time?
- What perception do we want?>

#### Success Metrics
<define measurable outcomes - from USER perspective:
- Response time targets (what the user perceives)
- User satisfaction metrics
- Task completion rates>

### 4️⃣ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
---

#### Scenario 1: Performance Improved
Given <the operation that was slow>
When <user performs the action>
Then <the response time is within target>
And <the user perceives the system as responsive>

#### Scenario 2: Functionality Preserved
Given <the optimized feature>
When <users perform all existing operations>
Then <all functionality works exactly as before>
And <no data is lost or corrupted>

#### Scenario 3: Consistent Performance
Given <the system under normal load>
When <multiple users perform the action>
Then <performance remains within acceptable range>
And <no users experience degraded service>

### 5️⃣ Out of Scope
---
<what this optimization does NOT include:
- Other performance issues not mentioned
- Feature changes
- Behavior modifications>

### 6️⃣ Dependencies
---
<list any prerequisites>
- Requires: <baseline measurements, monitoring in place?>
- Blocks: <what should wait for this improvement>
```
