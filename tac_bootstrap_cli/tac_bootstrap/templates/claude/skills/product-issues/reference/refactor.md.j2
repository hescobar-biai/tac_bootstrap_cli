# ♻️ Product Owner - Refactor Specification

Create a refactor specification for the `Task` using the `Specification Format`.

## Instructions

- You are a Product Owner. Focus on WHAT needs improvement and WHY it matters to the business.
- DO NOT include technical implementation details, file paths, or code architecture decisions.
- Focus on: maintainability benefits, developer productivity, long-term sustainability.
- Replace every `<instruction>` with your reasoned content.

## Specification Format

```md
## ♻️ Product Specification

### 1️⃣ Refactor Summary
---
<clear summary of what code improvement is needed>

### 2️⃣ Business Justification
---

#### Why This Matters
<explain why this refactor is important from a business perspective:
- How does it affect developer productivity?
- How does it reduce future maintenance costs?
- How does it enable future features?>

#### Priority Justification
<Critical | High | Medium | Low - explain why this priority>

#### Technical Debt Impact
<describe the cost of NOT doing this refactor:
- Slower feature development?
- Higher bug rates?
- Harder onboarding for new developers?>

### 3️⃣ Refactor Description
---

#### Current State
<describe the current state from a quality perspective:
- What makes the current code hard to work with?
- What problems do developers experience?>

#### Desired State
<describe the ideal state after refactoring:
- What will be easier?
- What will be more maintainable?>

#### Behavioral Guarantee
<CRITICAL: This refactor must NOT change any existing functionality.
List the behaviors that must remain exactly the same.>

### 4️⃣ Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
---

#### Scenario 1: Functionality Preserved
Given <the system before refactoring>
When <the refactoring is complete>
Then <all existing functionality works exactly as before>
And <all existing tests pass without modification>

#### Scenario 2: Quality Improved
Given <the refactored code>
When <developers work with the code>
Then <the code is easier to understand>
And <the code follows established patterns>

#### Scenario 3: No User Impact
Given <users interacting with the system>
When <they perform any existing operations>
Then <they experience no difference in behavior>
And <performance is equal or better>

### 5️⃣ Out of Scope
---
<what this refactor does NOT include:
- No new features
- No behavior changes
- No API changes (unless explicitly stated)>

### 6️⃣ Dependencies
---
<list any prerequisites or coordination needs>
- Requires: <what must be stable before refactoring>
- Blocks: <what should wait until this is done>
```
