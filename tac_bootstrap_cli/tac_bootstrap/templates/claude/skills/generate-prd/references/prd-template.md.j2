## Example: Celes Cost PRD (Key Sections)

Below are key sections from the completed celes-cost PRD to illustrate the expected quality:

### Problem Statement (example)

Organizations running workloads on Google BigQuery lack visibility into cost attribution across tenants, clients, environments, and query categories. Without granular cost analytics, teams cannot:

- Identify which tenants/clients drive the most spend
- Detect expensive or inefficient queries
- Track cost trends and forecast budgets
- Optimize cache utilization and slot efficiency

### Product Vision (example)

A self-hosted web dashboard that connects to BigQuery `jobs_executions` tables across multiple GCP environments (DEV, QAS, PRD) and provides real-time cost analytics with filtering, charting, and drill-down capabilities.

### Feature Map (example excerpt)

| ID | Feature | Description | Priority |
|----|---------|-------------|----------|
| F-01 | **Multi-Environment Querying** | Query across DEV, QAS, PRD simultaneously via UNION ALL | P0 |
| F-02 | **Tenant & Client Analysis** | Break down costs by tenant and client dimensions | P0 |
| F-03 | **Cost Trend Charts** | Time-series visualization (daily/weekly/monthly granularity) | P0 |
| F-05 | **Filter System** | Combined filters: date range, environment, client, category | P0 |
| F-14 | **Dark Mode** | System-preference-based dark theme | P2 |
| F-15 | **Docker Deployment** | One-command deployment via docker compose | P0 |

### Functional Requirement (example)

**FR-05: Cost Calculation**
- On-demand pricing: `bytes_billed / 1024^4 * $6.25/TiB`
- Price per TiB MUST be configurable via environment variable
- All costs displayed in USD with 2-4 decimal places
