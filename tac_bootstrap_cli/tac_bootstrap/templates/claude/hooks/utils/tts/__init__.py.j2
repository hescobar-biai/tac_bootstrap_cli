"""TTS utilities for {{ config.project.name }}.

Provides a unified interface for text-to-speech synthesis using multiple TTS engines.

Available TTS implementations:
- pyttsx3_tts: Offline TTS using system engines (synthesize_speech, save_to_file)
- openai_tts: OpenAI TTS API (synthesize_speech, save_audio_file)
- elevenlabs_tts: ElevenLabs TTS API (synthesize_speech, save_audio_file)

Import specific functions from submodules to use different TTS backends.
