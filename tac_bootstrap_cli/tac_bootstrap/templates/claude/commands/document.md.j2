# Document Feature

Generate markdown documentation for implemented features in {{ config.project.name }} by analyzing code changes and specifications.

## Variables

adw_id: $1
spec_path: $2 if provided, otherwise leave blank
documentation_screenshots_dir: $3 if provided, otherwise leave blank

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Changes
- Run `git diff origin/main --stat` to see changed files
- Run `git diff origin/main --name-only` for list of files
- For significant changes (>50 lines), run `git diff origin/main <file>`

### 2. Read Specification (if provided)
- If `spec_path` is provided, read to understand:
  - Original requirements and objectives
  - Expected functionality
  - Success criteria

### 3. Extract IDK Keywords
- Analyze the code changes and extract 3-8 Information Dense Keywords (IDK)
- If `canonical_idk.yml` exists, prioritize keywords from it
- Supplement canonical terms with feature-specific keywords as needed
- Keywords should represent core concepts, patterns, technologies, or domain terms

### 4. Generate Documentation
- Create file in `{{ config.paths.app_docs_dir | default('app_docs') }}/` with name: `feature-{adw_id}-{descriptive-name}.md`
- Follow the documentation format below including YAML frontmatter
- Focus on:
  - What was built (based on git diff)
  - How it works (technical implementation)
  - How to use it (user perspective)
  - Required configuration or setup
  - Testing instructions with executable bash commands

### 5. Update Conditional Documentation
- After creating the file, read `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md`
- Add entry for the new file with appropriate conditions

## Documentation Format
