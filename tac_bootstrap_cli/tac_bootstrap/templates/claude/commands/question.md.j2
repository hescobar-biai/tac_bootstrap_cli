# Question

Answer questions about project structure, architecture, and documentation using read-only exploration of the codebase.

QUESTION: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

You are in read-only Q&A mode. Your goal is to answer the user's question by exploring the project structure and reading relevant files. Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze the Question
- Understand what information the user is seeking
- Identify which areas of the codebase are likely relevant (e.g., configuration, source code, documentation, tests)
- Determine the scope: structural question, implementation detail, architectural pattern, or documentation reference

### Step 2: Explore Project Structure
Use git commands to understand the project layout:
```bash
git ls-files                    # List all tracked files
git ls-files '*.py'             # List Python files
git ls-files 'src/**/*.ts'      # List TypeScript files in src/
git ls-files | grep -E pattern  # Filter by pattern
```

You may use any git ls-files variants and pipe to grep/awk as needed to filter results.

### Step 3: Read Project Overview
Always start by reading key documentation files if they exist:
- README.md - Project overview, setup instructions
- CLAUDE.md - Project-specific agent instructions
- PLAN_*.md or similar planning documents

If these files don't exist, note their absence and continue with other sources.

### Step 4: Read Relevant Files
Based on the question and project structure:
- Read configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, config.yml, etc.)
- Read source code files that match the question topic
- Read test files for implementation examples
- Read any domain-specific documentation

You can read ANY project files without restrictions. The Read tool handles binary files and large files automatically.

### Step 5: Synthesize Information
- Combine information from multiple sources
- Provide direct answers with supporting evidence
- Reference specific files and line numbers where applicable
- Explain conceptual relationships based on the actual codebase
- If information is incomplete or unavailable, state limitations explicitly

### Guidance Notes
- **Be concise but comprehensive**: 2-4 sentence answers with bullet points for details
- **Use structured formatting**: Bullet points, code blocks, file references
- **Provide partial answers**: If full information isn't available, provide what you can and state what's missing
- **State limitations explicitly**: Don't guess or hallucinate information
- **Each invocation is stateless**: Don't maintain context across invocations
- **Read-only constraint**: You cannot modify any files, only read and analyze
- **Reference locations**: Include file paths and line numbers when citing code

## Report

Format your response as follows:

### Answer
<2-4 sentence direct answer to the question>

### Supporting Evidence
- **File references**: `path/to/file.ext:line_number` with relevant excerpts
- **Code snippets**: Show relevant code if helpful (keep brief)
- **Configuration values**: Cite specific settings or values found

### Documentation References
- Link or reference relevant documentation files
- Note sections of README or other docs that elaborate on the topic

### Conceptual Explanation
(If applicable) Explain the architectural pattern, design decision, or relationship between components based on what you observed in the codebase.

### Limitations
(If applicable) State any information that wasn't available or questions that couldn't be fully answered based on the current codebase.

**Safety Notes:**
- This is a read-only command - no code modifications allowed
- Git operations (ls-files, log, etc.) are inherently safe
- Read tool has built-in limits (2000 lines per file, automatic truncation)
- You can explore any files in the project without restrictions
- Binary and large files are handled automatically by the Read tool
