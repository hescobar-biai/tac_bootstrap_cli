# Resolve Failed E2E Test

Fix a specific failing E2E test using the provided failure details.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the E2E Test Failure**
   - Review the JSON data in `Test Failure Input`, paying attention to:
     - `test_name`: Name of the failed test
     - `test_path`: Path to the test file (needed for re-execution)
     - `error`: Specific error that occurred
     - `screenshots`: Screenshots captured showing the failure state
   - Understand what the test validates from a user interaction perspective

2. **Understand Test Execution**
   - Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md` to understand how E2E tests are executed
   - Read the test file specified in the `test_path` field from the JSON
   - Note the test steps, user story, and success criteria

3. **Reproduce the Failure**
   - IMPORTANT: Use `test_path` from the JSON to re-execute the specific E2E test
   - Follow the execution pattern from `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`
   - Observe browser behavior and confirm you can reproduce the exact failure
   - Compare the error you see with the error reported in the JSON

4. **Fix the Issue**
   - Based on your reproduction, identify the root cause
   - Make minimal, targeted changes to resolve only this failure
   - Consider common E2E issues:
     - Element selector changes
     - Timing issues (elements not ready)
     - UI layout changes
     - Application logic modifications
   - Ensure the fix aligns with the user story and test purpose

5. **Validate the Fix**
   - Re-execute the same E2E test step by step using `test_path` to confirm it passes
   - IMPORTANT: The test must complete successfully before considering it resolved
   - Do NOT run other tests or the full test suite
   - Focus only on fixing this specific E2E test
