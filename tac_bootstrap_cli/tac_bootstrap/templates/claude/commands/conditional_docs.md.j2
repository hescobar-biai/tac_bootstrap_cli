# Conditional Documentation Guide

This guide helps determine which documentation to read based on specific changes you need to make in the codebase.

## Instructions
- Review the task you've been assigned
- Check each documentation path in the Conditional Documentation section
- For each path, evaluate if any of the conditions apply to your task
  - IMPORTANT: Only read documentation if a condition matches your task
- IMPORTANT: Don't read documentation excessively. Only read if relevant.

## Conditional Documentation

- CLAUDE.md
  - Conditions:
    - When you need to understand how agents should work in the project
    - When you start working on any task
    - When you need a quick reference of commands and structure

- config.yml
  - Conditions:
    - When working with project configuration
    - When you need to understand configured paths and commands
    - When working with the template system

- constitution.md
  - Conditions:
    - When writing or reviewing code (for coding style and patterns)
    - When writing tests (for testing standards)
    - When making architectural decisions (for architecture guidelines)
    - When handling errors or writing user-facing messages (for UX/DX guidelines)
    - When optimizing code or investigating performance issues (for performance expectations)
    - During code review to reference standards

- README.md
  - Conditions:
    - When you need to understand the project's purpose
    - When you need to know how to use the application
    - On first contact with the project

- {{ config.paths.specs_dir }}/
  - Conditions:
    - When implementing a feature or bug fix
    - When you need to understand requirements for a specific task
    - When reviewing implementation against specifications

- app_docs/
  - Conditions:
    - When you need to understand previously implemented features
    - When working on related functionality
    - When you need context about architectural decisions

- ai_docs/
  - Conditions:
    - When you need reference documentation for AI tools and SDKs
    - When working with Claude Code, MCP, or other AI integrations
    - When you need examples of API usage

## Fractal Documentation

- When working with documentation or understanding code structure:
  - Read `docs/` directory for fractal documentation of each module
  - Each file in `docs/` corresponds to a folder in `{{ config.paths.app_root | default("src") }}/`

- When creating new modules or capabilities:
  - After implementation, run `/generate_fractal_docs changed` to update documentation
  - Ensure new modules have IDK docstrings before generating fractal docs

- When refactoring or moving files:
  - Run `/generate_fractal_docs full` to regenerate all documentation
  - Review `docs/` for outdated references

- When looking for canonical terminology:
  - Read `canonical_idk.yml` for approved domain keywords
  - Use these keywords in docstrings and documentation
