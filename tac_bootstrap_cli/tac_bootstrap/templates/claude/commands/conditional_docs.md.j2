# Conditional Documentation Guide

This guide helps determine which documentation to read based on specific changes you need to make in the codebase.

## Instructions

- Check each documentation path in the Conditional Documentation section
- For each path, evaluate if any of the conditions apply to your task
  - IMPORTANT: Only read documentation if a condition matches your task
- IMPORTANT: Don't read documentation excessively. Only read if relevant.
