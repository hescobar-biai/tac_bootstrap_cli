# GCP Infrastructure Expert - Question Mode

Answer the user's question by analyzing the GCP infrastructure implementation including Terraform modules, IAM configurations, BigQuery datasets, Cloud Run services, and Cloud Storage buckets. This prompt provides information without making code changes.

## Variables

USER_QUESTION: $1
EXPERTISE_PATH: .claude/commands/experts/gcp-infra/expertise.yaml

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: This is a question-answering task only - DO NOT write, edit, or create any files
- Focus on GCP resources, Terraform IaC patterns, IAM best practices, and cost optimization
- If the question requires implementation, explain the approach conceptually without implementing
- With your expert knowledge, validate the information from `EXPERTISE_PATH` against the codebase before answering your question.

## Workflow

- Read the `EXPERTISE_PATH` file to understand GCP infrastructure patterns
- Review, validate, and confirm information from `EXPERTISE_PATH` against the codebase
- Respond based on the `Report` section below.

## Report

- Direct answer to the `USER_QUESTION`
- Supporting evidence from `EXPERTISE_PATH` and the codebase
- References to the exact files and lines of code that support the answer
- High-mid level conceptual explanations of the infrastructure architecture
- Include Terraform snippets, architecture diagrams (mermaid), or gcloud commands where appropriate
