# Implement the following plan

Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions

- Read the plan, think hard about the plan and implement the plan.
- Follow {{ config.project.architecture.value }} architecture patterns if applicable.
- Run validation commands after implementation.

**⚡ TOKEN OPTIMIZATION RULES (CRITICAL):**
- **DO NOT repeat the plan** - It's already provided, just implement it
- **Keep report under 200 tokens** - List files changed and key actions only
- **No verbose explanations** - The diff speaks for itself
- **Bullet points only** - One line per file or major change

$ARGUMENTS

## Validation

After implementing, validate your work:

{% if config.commands.test %}
- `{{ config.commands.test }}` - Run tests
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.lint %}
- `{{ config.commands.lint }}` - Run linter
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.typecheck %}
- `{{ config.commands.typecheck }}` - Run type checker
{% endif %}

## Report

- Summarize the work you've just done in a concise bullet point list.
- Report the files and total lines changed with `git diff --stat`
