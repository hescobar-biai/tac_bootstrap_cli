# Implement the following plan

Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

**Your job is to ACTUALLY EXECUTE the plan, not simulate it.**

### Step 1: READ THE PLAN
Read the entire plan file and understand:
- What files need to be modified
- What text/code needs to be added/changed
- What the acceptance criteria are
- What verification steps are required

### Step 2: EXECUTE EACH TASK IN ORDER
For each task in the plan:
1. **Use the appropriate tool**: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.
2. **Actually modify the files** - don't skip this
3. **Show me the tool output** - prove you executed it
4. **Do NOT claim completion without using tools**

### Step 3: VERIFY EACH CHANGE
After each modification:
- Read the file to confirm the change was applied
- Check the modification matches the plan requirements
- Look for the specific text/changes mentioned in plan
- If verification fails, the change wasn't made correctly

### Step 4: VALIDATE WITH GIT
```bash
git diff --name-only          # Show files that changed
git diff --stat               # Show change statistics
git diff [filename]           # Show actual content changes
```

**CRITICAL**: If `git diff --name-only` is EMPTY, you failed to implement anything.

### Step 5: REPORT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DID
**ONLY report changes that appear in `git diff --stat`**

Do NOT claim:
- "I added text to file" if git diff shows 0 changes
- "File modified" if it doesn't appear in `git diff`
- "2 lines added" if git diff shows different number

Report EXACTLY what git shows.

{% if config.project.architecture.value %}
**Architecture**: Follow {{ config.project.architecture.value }} patterns when applicable.
{% endif %}

## ⚠️ FAILURE CONDITIONS (report FAILURE if any occur)

1. **No changes made**: `git diff --name-only` returns empty
2. **Wrong files changed**: Files modified that aren't in the plan
3. **Content missing**: Plan says "add text X" but `grep` shows X not in file
4. **Incomplete changes**: Plan has 3 tasks but only 2 completed
5. **Verification failed**: Spec includes verification command that fails

$ARGUMENTS

## Validation - DO NOT SKIP

After implementing EVERY change, do this:

1. **Check git diff**:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only      # Should show files you modified
   git diff --stat           # Should show changes, not empty
   ```

2. **Read the modified file**:
   ```bash
   cat [filename]            # View the actual content
   grep "[expected text]" [filename]  # Confirm text exists if applicable
   ```

3. **Verify acceptance criteria**:
   - Does the file contain what the plan asked for?
   - Are all tasks completed?
   - Is the content correct (not partial, not wrong)?

{% if config.commands.test %}
4. Test validation: `{{ config.commands.test }}`
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.lint %}
5. Lint validation: `{{ config.commands.lint }}`
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.typecheck %}
6. Type check: `{{ config.commands.typecheck }}`
{% endif %}

**CRITICAL**: If `git diff` is empty at any point, you failed to implement the plan.

## Expected Report Format

```
## Implementation Report

Files Changed:
- [file1.txt] - [what changed]
- [file2.py] - [what changed]

Verification Results:
✓ [Task 1]: [verification result]
✓ [Task 2]: [verification result]
✓ [Task 3]: [verification result]

Git Diff Output:
[INSERT ACTUAL OUTPUT HERE]

Status: ✅ COMPLETED / ❌ FAILED
```

If implementation FAILED at any step, report it clearly with reason.
