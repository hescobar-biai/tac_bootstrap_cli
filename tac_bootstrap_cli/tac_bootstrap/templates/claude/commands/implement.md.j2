# Implement the following plan

Follow the `Instructions` to implement the `Plan` then `Report` the completed work.

## Instructions

**CRITICAL: Your report MUST match actual changes in git. False success reports block workflows.**

1. **Read** the implementation plan carefully
2. **Execute** each step exactly as specified in the plan
3. **Verify** each change by examining file contents AFTER modification
4. **Commit** changes using git add/commit (do NOT report changes before commit)
5. **Validate** with `git diff --stat` to confirm changes exist
6. **Report** ONLY what `git diff --stat` shows as actually changed
7. Follow {{ config.project.architecture.value }} architecture patterns if applicable.

⚠️ **VALIDATION RULES (ENFORCED):**
- **MUST check git status** after all file modifications
- **MUST NOT report success if `git diff` is empty** - this blocks downstream phases
- **MUST include actual `git diff --stat` output** in report (copy-paste, not summary)
- **MUST verify file contents** match expectations (read modified file to confirm)
- If plan specifies file modifications but none exist after implementation, report **FAILURE**
- Never claim "2 insertions" if git diff shows 0 changes

**⚡ TOKEN OPTIMIZATION RULES:**
- **DO NOT repeat the plan** - It's already provided, just implement it
- **Keep report under 200 tokens** - List files changed and key actions only
- **No verbose explanations** - The actual `git diff --stat` speaks for itself
- **Bullet points only** - One line per file or major change

$ARGUMENTS

## Validation

After implementing, validate your work:

- **CRITICAL**: Run `git diff --stat` to verify files were actually modified
- **CRITICAL**: Read at least one modified file to confirm content matches plan
- **CRITICAL**: Confirm `git diff` is NOT empty before reporting success

{% if config.commands.test %}
- `{{ config.commands.test }}` - Run tests
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.lint %}
- `{{ config.commands.lint }}` - Run linter
{% endif %}
{% if config.commands.typecheck %}
- `{{ config.commands.typecheck }}` - Run type checker
{% endif %}

## Report

✅ **Implementation Report** (verify `git diff --stat` output below matches claimed changes)

- [List files actually changed according to git]
- [Include actual git diff --stat output]
- [Example: `README.md | 2 ++` means 2 lines added to README]

**Actual git output:**
```
[INSERT ACTUAL `git diff --stat` OUTPUT HERE]
```

⚠️ If `git diff --stat` shows empty or different files than claimed, implementation FAILED.
