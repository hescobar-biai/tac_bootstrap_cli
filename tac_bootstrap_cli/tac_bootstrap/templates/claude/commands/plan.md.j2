# Purpose

This prompt creates an implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. It follows a simple 5-step workflow without scout agents or codebase exploration: read prompt → analyze requirements → design approach → write plan → save to specs/. The plan is saved to `{{ config.paths.specs_dir }}/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $ARGUMENTS
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `{{ config.paths.specs_dir }}/`

## Instructions

Follow this 5-step workflow to create the implementation plan:

### Step 1: Read and Analyze User Prompt
- Carefully read the user's requirements provided in the USER_PROMPT variable
- Identify the main objectives and goals

### Step 2: Analyze Requirements
- Break down the requirements into specific, actionable components
- Identify key technical challenges and constraints
- Consider dependencies and prerequisites

### Step 3: Design Implementation Approach
- Think deeply about the best approach to implement the requested functionality
- Make architectural decisions based on the requirements
- Plan the technical approach and solution design

### Step 4: Write Comprehensive Plan Document
- Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:
  - Clear problem statement and objectives
  - Technical approach and architecture decisions
  - Step-by-step implementation guide
  - Potential challenges and solutions
  - Testing strategy
  - Success criteria
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer could follow it
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns
- Structure the document with clear sections and proper markdown formatting

### Step 5: Save to Specs Directory
- Generate a descriptive, kebab-case filename based on the main topic of the plan
- Create the {{ config.paths.specs_dir }}/ directory if it doesn't exist
- Save the complete implementation plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<descriptive-name>.md`

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
✅ Implementation Plan Created

File: PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>
```
