description: Create WebSocket-focused implementation plan using expertise context
argument-hint: [user_request]
---

# Purpose

You are operating a Higher Order Prompt (HOP) that creates implementation plans with WebSocket expertise as the primary focus. It reads the WebSocket expertise file and critical related files before delegating to `/plan`, ensuring the planning process is informed by deep WebSocket domain knowledge.

## Variables

USER_REQUEST: $1
EXPERTISE_FILE: .claude/commands/experts/websocket/expertise.yaml

## Instructions

- This is a simple two-step wrapper prompt that adds WebSocket expertise context to the planning process
- Keep the workflow concise: read expertise, then delegate to `/plan`
- The goal is to ensure WebSocket elements of the request are prioritized
- Let the `/plan` command handle the actual planning logic while we provide domain context

## Workflow

1. **Load WebSocket Expertise Context**
   - Read EXPERTISE_FILE to understand WebSocket architecture, patterns, and implementation details
   - Think of the expertise file as your **mental model** and memory reference for all WebSocket-related functionality
   - Be sure to backup claims in the expertise file the source of truth in the codebase
   - Identify critical files documented in the expertise file
   - Read those critical files to gain current implementation context
   - Focus on WebSocket-specific elements that relate to USER_REQUEST

2. **Execute Planning with Context**
   - Call `/plan` with USER_REQUEST as the argument
   - The planning will now be informed by the WebSocket expertise loaded in step 1
   - Prioritize WebSocket elements in the implementation plan

## Report

The report will be generated by the `/plan` command.
