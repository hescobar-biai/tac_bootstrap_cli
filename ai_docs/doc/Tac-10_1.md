# Agentic Prompt Engineering: The Prompt as the Unit of Engineering

The prompt is now the **fundamental unit of engineering**.  
And with agents, every prompt you create becomes a **force multiplier**.

One well-crafted prompt can generate **tens or hundreds of hours** of productive work.  
One bad prompt compounds failure at the exact same rate.

So the real question is:

> How do you consistently create prompts that deliver **2×, 5×, 10×, even 100×** returns on your time?

## The Agentic Mindset Shift

This starts with a **senior engineering mindset shift**.

You must ask yourself:

> Who am I creating these prompts for?

The answer is no longer just:
- You
- Your team

You are now engineering for **three audiences**:

1. You  
2. Your team  
3. Your agents  

This is the **stakeholder trifecta** for the age of agents.

Most engineers have **not** made this shift yet.

## Reusable Agentic Prompts as Engineering Assets

The winners are building:

- Libraries of **reusable**
- **battle-tested**
- **agentic prompts**
- with **composable sections**

These prompts work like **LEGO blocks**:
- swap sections in
- swap sections out
- scale engineering impact with compute

You saw this hands-on in TAC.

Every prompt we built had a **similar structure**:
- some sections present
- some sections omitted
- but always consistent

By writing prompts consistently, we communicate with:
- ourselves
- our future selves
- our team
- and most importantly, **our agents**

Once prompts become reusable, you reach a level where:
- you **know** what a prompt will do
- given a certain input

This accelerates the journey:
- from **in-loop**
- to **out-loop**
- all the way to **ZTE**

This is the **north star of agentic coding**.

## AFK Engineering & Agentic Leverage

The goal is simple:

- hand off more work to compute
- set up systems that trigger workflows
- remove the need for your constant presence

You want to build **AFK agents**.

And all of this comes back to a skill that was once mocked:

> Prompt engineering.

But things have changed.

We are now in the era of **agentic prompt engineering**.

Every prompt you write can:
- call tens or hundreds of tool invocations
- run for minutes or hours
- orchestrate real work

That makes prompt engineering one of the **most important skills** for modern engineers.

## The 7 Agentic Prompt Formats

We are going to study:
- the **seven most powerful agentic prompt formats**
- and the **exact sections** that make them up

We’re not just learning prompts, but:
- the individual **sections**
- how useful they are
- how difficult they are to operate

Common sections include:
- Title
- Metadata
- Purpose
- Workflow
- Variables
- Instructions
- Codebase Structure
- Report / Output

The prompt is everything.

Context engineering is critical, but the **prompt dictates everything**.

---

## Level 1: The High-Level Prompt

### What it is

- A reusable
- ad-hoc
- static prompt
- for repeated work your agent can already do well

### Structure

Contains **1–3 sections**:
1. Title  
2. High-level prompt  
3. (Optional) Purpose  

This is the fastest way to hand off repeated work.

### Evaluation

| Section | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Title | C-tier | D-tier |
| High-level prompt | C-tier | D-tier |
| Purpose | B-tier | D-tier |

This is a **great place to start**  
and a **terrible place to stop**.

Three repetitions mark a pattern.  
Once you repeat work three times — write a prompt.

---

## Level 2: The Workflow Prompt (The Pillar)

This is a **major milestone**.

The workflow prompt introduces a **sequential execution model**.

### Why it matters

The **workflow section** is:
- S-tier usefulness
- low difficulty
- the most important section in agentic prompts

The workflow prompt itself is:
- A-tier usefulness
- C-tier difficulty

This is the foundation for everything that follows.

---

## Key Sections Introduced

### Metadata
- Tool constraints
- Models
- Agent capabilities

**Evaluation:**  
C-tier usefulness, C-tier difficulty

---

### Workflow
A **step-by-step execution plan**.

- Sequential
- Explicit
- Predictable

This is where real agentic power begins.

---

### Report (Output)
Defines:
- output format
- structure
- serialization (JSON, YAML, Markdown, etc.)

This is your **output contract**.

**Evaluation:**  
B-tier usefulness, C-tier difficulty

---

## Input → Workflow → Output

Every strong prompt follows this mental model:

1. **Input**
2. **Workflow**
3. **Output**

This makes prompts:
- understandable
- reviewable
- composable
- scalable

---

## Variables: Where Prompts Become Powerful

Variables unlock **reuse at scale**.

You can have:
- dynamic variables (passed in)
- static variables (defined in prompt)

They allow:
- parameterized execution
- shared understanding
- massive reduction in repetition

### Evaluation

| Section | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Variables | A-tier | B-tier |

This is where prompts stop being static instructions and become **tools**.

---

## Codebase Structure (Context Map)

This section provides:
- a **map**, not instructions
- where files live
- what they do at a high level

You are **not** telling the agent to read files here.  
You are helping it **navigate faster**.

### Evaluation

| Section | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Codebase Structure | C-tier | D-tier |

The value is **speed**, not capability.

---

## Level 3: Control Flow Prompts

This level introduces:
- conditionals
- early returns
- loops

Examples:
- stop execution if a variable is missing
- repeat a workflow N times
- exit immediately on failure

This is where prompts start behaving like **programs**.

### Evaluation

| Prompt Type | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Control Flow Prompt | A-tier | B-tier |

---

## Level 4: Delegation Prompts (Agents Calling Agents)

This is where prompts:
- spawn other agents
- pass them instructions
- aggregate results

You are no longer just prompting.  
You are **orchestrating compute**.

Key characteristics:
- variables passed into sub-agents
- prompts that generate prompts
- parallel execution

### Evaluation

| Prompt Type | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Delegation Prompt | S-tier | A-tier |

This is advanced engineering.

You must manage:
- information flow
- nondeterminism
- agent boundaries

But this is also the **future of engineering**.

---

## The Core Principle

Consistency beats novelty.

- Same structure
- Same sections
- Same mental model

Confusion is the enemy of scale.

If a coworker can:
- read the prompt
- understand it
- run it end-to-end

Then your agent can too.

---

## Final Takeaway

Agentic prompt engineering is about:
- leverage
- delegation
- compute orchestration

The more compute you can control,
the more intelligence you can deploy.

Prompts are no longer text.

They are **systems**.
