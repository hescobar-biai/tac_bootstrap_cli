oversight. How else will you know unless you're trying to do this? Okay, I can
0:12
guarantee you right now you are doing engineering work you do not have to do.
0:17
I can tell you that as a fact. Okay, unless you're one of the one fractions
0:21
of a percent of engineer that likely have already been following a lot of my
0:25
work. There is work that you are just doing that you do not need to do.
0:28
Everything starts small and then it compounds. Your first agent should ship
0:31
a class of chores that you know you can ship over and over, right? Simple stuff
0:36
like this, front-end changes, database migrations, right? Simple, loweffort,
0:40
easy to validate, easy to test. Encode your engineering, template engineering.
0:44
Let your agentic system, let your ADWs prove to you that they can do this work,
0:49
right? That's your responsibility to encode that into the agentic layer.
0:53
Everything starts small. Think in the gray. But but once you start down this
0:56
path, you realize something very quickly. It will compound. Your first
0:59
agent ships a chore. Your next agentic workflows start shipping bugs, then
1:03
features. And then they'll do it five times. And they'll do it 20 times. And
1:07
then they'll do it, here's the important part, five times in a row. And you'll
1:11
realize that you add no value by reviewing. In fact, you slowed things
1:15
down. And this is the key. Of course, here in tactical agent coding, you and
1:20
I, we're not focused on the present. We're not focused on the past. We want
1:23
to be on that in that sweet spot, leaning toward the future. Here's a
1:27
here's a great visual for you. The future is coming at you at a constant
1:30
pace. You have three options, really four options. You can neglect the change
1:35
and just run away. Do it the old way. Go in the loop. Stay in the loop. Fine. You
1:38
can stand still. Let the future come to you. This is faster than running away.
1:42
Right? You don't disagree with the future, but you're not doing anything
1:45
about it. Fine. Obviously, that's not us, right? Then you can move toward the
1:49
future. As it's coming toward you, you move toward the future. This is
1:52
powerful. this is where you want to be. Or you can take everything we've done
1:55
here and sprint. Sprint toward the future of engineering. Beat everyone
2:00
else there. Get this agentic layer in your codebase. Get this up and running.
2:04
Have agents building for you. Build a system that builds a system. This gets
2:07
you to an incredible place. And this is like a simple simple comparison, right?
2:12
Imagine an engineer that that runs toward the future, right? They set up
2:15
agents in the codebase to solve problem classes. At the end of the day, couple
2:19
weeks, maybe a month of investment, right? Probably not. probably don't need
2:22
that. But, you know, let's say a week to a few weeks of investing in your agentic
2:26
layer. Over time, all of a sudden, they have 90% confidence that a whole class
2:31
of chores or bugs will ship with minimal risk. They write a single prompt, hit
2:35
enter, and ship into production. Zero touch engineering. 90% of the time
2:39
there's no issues. And that number keeps going up. Every tool release, every
2:43
model release, every time they improve their layer. Okay. Now, imagine the
2:47
other scenario. Let's say you're standing still or you're moving away,
2:51
right? Say you're running away. You open up the terminal. You look at Jira,
2:54
right? You look at your task management tool. You pull it up in your in loop
2:58
IDE. Hopefully, you're using cloud code. But on board with some of these ideas,
3:01
you're probably maybe not even using it, right? Maybe you don't use an agent at
3:05
all. You write the prompt. You sit, you wait, you iterate, you retest, and you
3:09
do all this stupid stuff that you can have your agents do. Okay? Tell me who
3:13
wins this. Tell me who makes their business more money. Tell me which
3:17
engineer is better. Okay, I'm getting like getting super into this because
3:20
it's so important. This is it, guys. This is this is the peak. This is the
3:23
pinnacle. This is the change that you have to make. Right? The the there's the
3:27
code. There's the AGWS, right? We're going to break things down. We're going
3:30
to go from the compositional level up to concrete examples in lesson 8, right?
3:34
We're going to round things out in a fantastic fashion. But the real thing,
3:38
the real hurdle, the challenge of tactical agent coding is about your
3:44
belief set. You have to believe that the agentic layer is worth investing into
3:48
you. You have to trust me. You have to invest into this. Okay? If you don't
3:53
believe that your agents can run your codebase, you're cooked. All right? I I
3:57
can't be any more blunt than I am here. I'm I'm trying to give you everything
4:01
you need here. Okay? If you think that zero-ouch engineering is in the far
4:05
future for you, that's fine. You know what? You might be right. But it's not
4:09
about being right. It's about being prepared to win. It's about thinking in
4:12
the gray so that you can get the gains as soon as they're available. This is
4:16
not a black and white thing. It's not on and off. It's progression. It's
4:19
improvement. It's iteration. You know this. You're an engineer. So hopefully
4:23
that monologue was useful for you. Let's come full circle here. If you do all
4:26
this, if you ride this curve, if you even get to out loop, start progressing
4:31
towards zero touch engineering. I promise you if you do this right, you
4:34
will be the engineer they can't replace. Why is that? It's because you understand
4:38
and control the agentic layer of your codebase. This is the area of highest
4:42
leverage. I don't think it's farfetched at all to say you get exponential
4:46
leverage by allowing agents to run your codebase and by templating your
4:50
engineering. Okay, I don't think that's farfetched at all. And I mean this from
4:54
a brute objective career defensibility standpoint, from a tactical angle,
5:00
you'll understand this technology so well that it would be crazy for anyone
5:04
in your organization, anyone on your team to conceive of letting you go.
5:08
It'll be the opposite, right? They'll be scrambling to try to keep you around and
5:12
try to spread your principles of AI coding and spread your tactics of agent
5:16
coding to your team. Not only is this extremely great, right, moving up the
5:20
stack, wielding more compute in parallel, um, not only is this great for
5:24
your career and defensibility and, you know, advancement, but you're going to
5:28
send your engineering team to the next level and therefore your company, right?
5:32
The tech industry, VCs, talking heads, they're all wondering where the big AI
5:37
gains will come from. They're wondering what's all the capex spend for. I've
5:41
known this answer from the beginning. It's not AGI, it's not ASI, right? Since
5:45
the beginning, since GPT3.5, when I saw this technology and started moving ahead
5:50
of the curve, I knew the answer from the beginning. It's you, the engineer with
5:54
their boots on the ground, solving one problem at a time, shipping real value,
5:59
using AI like no one else can, using compute like no one else can, except the
6:04
problem. And this is the tricky part. Focusing on the right problem is key.
6:09
The problem you're solving is one that lets you scale your capabilities beyond
6:13
imagination with agents. What's the cost? What's the trick? Here in tax 7,
6:18
you have everything you need to win. The next step is just to invest and master
6:23
the agentic layer. That's it. This is your moment. If you do this right, it
6:28
will change everything. This is the most important lesson in tac
6:32
from a belief's perspective. You have to believe that this is the right direction
6:36
to go. Before we reveal the secret of tactical agent coding, let's just review
6:40
our zero-ouch engineering workflow here. It should almost be shipped by now. This
6:45
is a simple feature. We're on the documentation step. So, we're almost
6:48
there. You can see here once again, our engineering has been encoded. We have
6:52
screenshots in our review phase in a review step. Background is green, right?
6:56
Super super simple, right? There is the validation 1 minute ago. Our agents are
7:00
working for us. They're validating their work. This is a great example of
7:04
something you can just ship to prod. There is no value in me doing this,
7:08
right? There is no value in me reviewing this. So there we go. We just got the
7:11
documentation phase. And in a moment here, this is going to ship all the way
7:15
out to prod. In our case, prod is just pushing to the main branch. There's
7:18
nothing crazy to see here, but for you, this will be your deploy, go to staging,
7:22
go to production, however your engineering is configured. How are we
7:26
going to round out tactical agent coding, right? What has this all been
7:30
about? Obviously, here you can see the trend. It's about the agent layer. But
7:33
uh let me just share the secret with you. Zero- touch engineering is the next
7:37
stage in the velocity scale. This is an advanced edge next level concept, but
7:42
this is something you want to be working toward. This is the tactic of lesson 7.
7:45
Target zero touch engineering. In the end, you want no overview, no oversight
7:50
because it's been embedded into your agents, right? Your agents have gotten
7:53
so good and your templates have gotten so great that your agents know how you
7:57
would do the work. And you know, how is this possible? It's only possible
8:01
because you've encoded your engineering. You've told your agents. You've
8:04
instructed your system. You've trained your system to know when things are
8:07
ready for production, right? Maybe you add another step on the software
8:10
developer life cycle. Maybe you add that key deploy check step, bunch of
8:14
deterministic deploy checks, whatever you want to do. Maybe you go super hard
8:18
on your review step. Maybe you add video to your review. Maybe you add double
8:22
agent check. Right? Maybe you parallelize the review step so that
8:25
three agents have to say, three pipelines of agents have to say this is
8:28
right. You can run the fusion chain on agents. Okay, it doesn't matter, right?
8:32
It really doesn't matter. And this leads us to the secret of tactical agentic
8:36
coding. This is what everything's been building up to. The secret of tactical
8:39
agent coding is that it's not about the software developer life cycle at all.
8:43
It's about composible agentic primitives you can use to solve any engineering
8:48
problem class. I'm just going to say that again. The secret of tactical
8:51
agentic coding is that it's not about the software developer life cycle at
8:56
all. It's about composable agentic primitives you can use to solve any
9:01
engineering problem class. The software developer life cycle is powerful, but
9:05
it's a remnant of the past. It's been very powerful. It's still very relevant.
9:09
It's something that we bet big on, but there's no doubt in my mind it is not
9:13
the optimal way to run software with agents. This is a new paradigm of
9:17
building arbitrary AI developer workflows that can and will outperform
9:23
the software developer life cycle. It's all about the composable pieces that you
9:27
put together. It's going to look a bit different for every single organization
9:31
and every single engineer. And yes, likely your AI developer workflows,
9:35
right? Your end to-end system will contain similar steps, right? Plan,
9:39
build, test, review, document. But my point here is it's not about these
9:43
steps. It's not about the software developer life cycle. What we've done
9:46
here is throughout tactical agent coding, the key has been showing off how
9:50
you can use and compose the new fundamental units of engineering to
9:54
solve problem classes, right? Sets of problems. We're not solving one-off
9:59
problems anymore. All we've been doing is showcasing what this could look like
10:04
inside of the agentic layer of your codebase. Okay? What what let me be
10:07
super clear. I'm saying that this arrangement of ADWs is completely
10:12
arbitrary. There is no one way to do this. The one way is the way that ships
10:17
into your codebase. This is just a starting point, right? This is a package
10:20
for me to deliver a message to you. It's about how you organize your codebase.
10:24
It's about always having feedback loops. Okay? We're not coding anymore, right?
10:29
We've stopped coding. We've templated our engineering and our agents can ship
10:33
on our behalf. When we ship, we adopt their perspective. And of course, when
10:38
you put all this together, you can stay out the loop because you have one agent
10:42
operating on one prompt with a single purpose. You have more precision while
10:46
other engineers are trying to stack up into one context window. You're firing
10:51
strongly defined specialized agents that execute one task at a time and hand off
10:56
their work. You are composing. You are orchestrating intelligence. It's about
11:01
the primitives. This is the secret of tactical agent coding. Let's check our
11:06
zero touch engineering workflow and you can see here uh it has been deployed to
11:11
production. Okay, the issue is closed. All I did was write this prompt, update
11:15
the background color. Of course, yes, just like we've talked about, this is
11:18
just a starting point. Agents can push more than this. They can do more than
11:23
this, but it's all about progression. Think in the gray and don't reject the
11:27
ideas of the future. Target zero touch engineering. This is the tactic of
11:32
lesson seven. This is your north star when you are building out the agentic
11:36
layer of your codebase. In the back of your head, you want to think, how can I
11:39
build this so that I can gain confidence to one day run one prompt and have
11:44
everything shipped to production. Don't run toward the future. Don't walk toward
11:47
it. Sprint into the future. This is live. Let's go ahead. Um, you can see
11:52
here's the blue color. I'm going to open up code. Get pool origin main. And look
12:00
at that. Our agents shipped it end to end. It's in production. This is zero-
12:04
touch engineering. This is the future of engineering. This is what happens when
12:08
you use the tactics of agentic coding. All right. So, what happens next? Take a
12:13
moment to just appreciate what we've done here. We have seen the future of
12:17
where this is all going, right? We've transcended the traditional engineering
12:21
velocity scale. Inloop outloop zero touch coding. You understand that the
12:25
agentic layer is the highest leverage point in your codebase. This is the
12:29
place where 1x input becomes 10x output and 10x input becomes 100x if you invest
12:35
in this layer. Okay. Everything I've shown you, everything we've worked
12:38
through in tax so far, the plan, build, test, review, and document is just one
12:42
way to compose a gentic primitives. The software developer life cycle we've been
12:47
using is powerful. It works, but it's a package for me to deliver a message to
12:52
you. The real secret is that it's about the composable units, the agentic
12:56
primitives, all the way down to the prompt level, all the way down to cloud
12:59
code, all the way up to how you organize your codebase, how you add tests,
13:03
documentation, how you add types, and how you build out prompts, specs, plans,
13:08
templates, and at the highest level, how you organize AI developer workflows,
13:13
ADWs. You'll want to resist this and you'll doubt that Outloop and ZTE are
13:18
the future of engineering. But this is the crux of tactical agent coding. This
13:23
is the real challenge I have for you in this course. It's not about the code.
13:27
The ideas are powerful, but the most important thing is that you must update
13:31
your beliefs. This is a belief change that you must make for 10 to 100x scaled
13:37
engineering with agents. And once you do this for yourself, something incredible
13:41
will happen. Once you truly get this and start building it out, once you see the
13:44
productivity gains, you're going to have several aha moments and then you'll
13:48
realize that you can unlock this value for your team and for your org. In loop
13:52
agent to coding is the lowest hanging fruit. Do not remain here. You are an
13:56
engineer, not a coder. Build the system that builds the system and you will
14:00
become an irreplaceable engineer. Focus on the agentic layer over everything
14:05
else. Clear your schedule. Tell your boss. Tell your lead. Tell your team.
14:09
And most importantly, tell yourself, okay? Because if you do this right, it
14:13
will change everything. What we're going to do next in lesson 8, we're going to
14:17
blow this idea wide open. Okay? The primitives are the atoms of agentic
14:22
engineering. Master them and you can build any molecular structure you need.
14:26
Think about what this means. Every codebase has unique problems. Every team
14:29
has unique workflows. Every domain has unique challenges. But primitives remain
14:34
constant and composable. In lesson 8, your final lesson, we're going to focus
14:39
in on this. We're going to do two things. We're going to revisit the atoms
14:44
of agentic coding, the new fundamental primitives of agentic coding that you
14:48
can use. And then we're going to look at compositions of them. We're going to
14:51
scale up and we're going to look at different codebase types with their own
14:54
agentic layers solving their own unique problems that you likely have
14:58
encountered in your engineering. Okay? give you many code bases you can use to
15:02
explore, understand and quick start your agentic coding of your agentic layer.
15:09
Okay, you'll see how these primitives composed differently for web app CLI
15:12
tools, notebooks. Most importantly, you'll understand how to jumpstart the
15:16
process of building your agentic layer for your codebase and your domain
15:20
problem. And finally, we're going to look beyond the edge. Right at the end
15:22
of lesson 8, just like in principled ed coding, we're going to look at how we
15:26
can best position ourselves to win today's engineering and tomorrow's
15:30
engineering. Full recap. You've reached zero- touch engineering. You now
15:34
understand where this all goes from in loop to outloop to zero engineering.
15:39
You've discovered the secret. You have the full picture. As you close the loop
15:43
on this course, as you close the loop on tactical agent coding, you have to
15:47
answer this question. Are you running away from the future? Are you standing
15:50
still? Are you moving toward it or are you going to join me and sprint toward
15:54
the future with these tactics of agentic coding? Great work here. Thanks for
15:59
following me through this. I hope everything makes sense to you. I'll see
16:02
you at the edge in lesson eight.
