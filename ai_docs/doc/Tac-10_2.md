# AI Docs Spectrum: Load AI Docs, Delegation, and Prompt Levels

Let’s open it up: **Load AI docs**.

With great agentic prompt engineering, we collapse everything and understand one step at a time:

**Metadata → Title → Purpose → Input → Workflow → Output**

Every single time.

**Consistency beats complexity.**  
Consistency makes you faster, makes your team faster, and makes your agents faster once you find the working formula.

And the working formula is exactly what these prompt formats provide.

---

## Load AI Docs (Delegation Prompt)

In this **Load AI docs** delegation prompt, we have:

- **Variables:** just one **static variable**
- A rule to **delete old docs after 24 hours**
- An **AI docs directory** that holds documentation for agents

When we open it, the agent has deleted the docs (because they were older than 24 hours) and is now reloading them.

### Loop + Sub-agent Delegation

We also see a loop and an explicit information-dense keyword we can reference throughout prompts.

We’re looping and having our agent call sub-agents directly:

- **Five doc-scraper agents** scrape documentation
- Each writes output to a new file
- The docs arrive incrementally in the **AI docs** directory

This is delegation. This is offloading.

This is the **D** in the **R&D framework** of elite context engineering.

### Report Format

There’s a simple but specific report format, and the primary agent returns exactly in that structure:

- AI docs report
- success / failure
- URL
- markdown path

This is **control**.

We know exactly what will happen when we kick off the prompt.

That’s the key for transitioning to **outloop agentic coding**:
You need to **know** what your prompts are going to do.

The best way to know is:
- be consistent
- test
- prove out your agentic prompts

---

## Background Prompt (Delegation + Control Flow)

Next: the **background prompt**.

And yes—this repetition may feel boring, but it’s how you write great prompts at scale, over and over, for:

- you
- your team
- your agents

We stay consistent:

**Metadata → Title → Purpose**

Purpose uses direct language:

> Run a Cloud Code instance in the background to perform tasks autonomously while you continue working.

Purpose is clearly defined in 1–2 sentences.

### Variables + Instructions

We have **three dynamic variables**.

Then we have an **Instructions** section with auxiliary information supporting the workflow.

### Workflow

The workflow is the step-by-step play.

This one becomes complex because it details how to kick off a brand-new agent via the CLI.

It also **updates the system prompt** in a major way.  
We’ll cover system prompts vs user prompts later, but the key here is:

- This agent kicks off another **primary agent**
- That agent reports to a report file while running in the background
- Using the model we specify

This is a **delegation prompt**:
your agent passes work to other agents.

---

## Level Five: Higher-Order Prompts (Prompts Inside Prompts)

Level five is perfect for agentic workflows where:

- some elements are dynamic and change
- but the top-level infrastructure stays the same

Example: the **build** prompt.

Same classic format:

**Metadata → Title → Purpose → Variables → Workflow → Report → Input → Work → Output**

### The Key Capability

We are now passing **prompts into prompts**.

We pass in a plan path (e.g., `specs/...md`) produced by something like quick-plan, chore builder, feature builder, or expert planners.

This higher-order prompt provides:
- a consistent scaffold
- while the lower-level work changes dynamically

### Tier Placement

- **Usefulness:** B-tier (arguably A-tier)
- **Difficulty:** A-tier

Powerful if you know what you’re doing.

---

## Level Six: Template Meta Prompt (Prompt That Builds Prompts)

Level six is the **template meta prompt**.

This is a prompt used to create another prompt in a specific format.

Levels 1–4 cover most real engineering prompts (80–90%).  
Levels 5–7 are more meta: prompts building prompts, improving prompts.

Template metaprompts are essential because they let you teach your agents:

> How you and your team build.

We again see the same structure:

**Metadata → Title → Purpose → Variables → Workflow**

We pass in the high-level prompt that becomes the new prompt to generate.

### Documentation as Context Map

We also see a section labeled **Documentation**.

This is actually a **context map** (similar to codebase structure):
- it shows what exists and where
- the agent can pull in relevant content before operating

### Template Section

The key new section is the **Template**.

This provides:
- the exact output structure
- the exact formula to generate

The agent fills in the blanks while staying inside the specified structure.

This is the prompt format that accelerates your velocity:

> The prompt that creates your other prompts.

It’s hard to use because you are writing:
- a prompt
- that writes prompts

But once prompt formats are consistent:

You should build the prompt that generates your prompts.

That scales agentic engineering velocity dramatically.

### Example: Plan a New Vue3 App

Another example is a prompt that creates a plan for a new Vue3 + TypeScript MVP.

It includes:
- codebase structure/context map
- template section for the plan format
- report section (e.g., return only the path to the plan)

This is stacking and swapping sections intentionally.

Hard, but high return.

---

## Level Seven: Self-Improving Prompts (Agent Experts)

Final level: **self-improving prompts**, usually in an experts directory.

This uses an **Expertise** section:

- specialized knowledge for a specific codebase area
- updated dynamically over time

We move from:
- prompts generating prompts (meta prompts)

to:
- prompts updating prompts (self-improving prompts)

This is an advanced pattern:
- prompts evolve
- expertise grows
- context inside prompts gets updated live

### Tier Placement

- **Usefulness:** A-tier
- **Skill requirement:** S-tier (very hard)

---

## Two Sections Not Covered Yet

### Examples
Examples show what output (or behavior) should look like.

- Very useful
- Low skill required
- Can drastically improve agent performance

Placed just below variables.

### Relevant Files
Similar to codebase structure:
- speeds navigation
- gives quick file references

Not game-breaking.

- **Usefulness:** C-tier
- **Skill requirement:** C-tier

---

## Why Template Meta Prompts Matter Most

If you unlock level six (template meta prompts), your engineering velocity accelerates fast:

- the prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering
- engineers who create more and better prompts at scale win

Once you can create the prompt that helps create prompts:
you move much faster than other engineers.

You should be writing **tons of prompts**:
- encoding
- reusing
- templating your engineering into your codebase
- as an outer agentic layer

---

## System Prompts vs User Prompts

The key difference is:

### Scope + Persistence

**System prompt:**
- rules for every conversation
- rules for every user prompt
- mistakes scale to every run
- you write once, run many times
- hard to change mid-conversation
- must handle many scenarios

Most engineers write far more user prompts than system prompts.

You must be more delicate with system prompts.

### Why It Matters

A bad user prompt is annoying and you iterate.

A bad system prompt is bad instructions for the **whole job**.

System prompts matter most when you build your own specialized agents.

### Appending vs Overwriting

In the background prompt example:
- we append key rules to the system prompt

A full system prompt overwrite is very powerful but dangerous.

### System Prompt Guidance

In general, system prompts should lean on:

- **Purpose**
- **Instructions**
- **Examples**

Workflows can be useful for sub-agents (do a specific thing),
but for primary agents you often want a looser structure to avoid removing too much agency.

Workflows reduce agency to increase determinism.

## Final Principles

Two big ideas:

1. **Communicate extraordinarily well** to your agents.
2. Use **consistent prompt formats** with **swappable sections** (LEGO blocks).

The most important section by far is:

> **Workflow** — the step-by-step play.

You want to create, read, update, and delete prompts at light speed, at the right level.

Usually:
- level 3 or 4 is enough for most teams
- template meta prompts (level 6) are the big velocity unlock

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Finish TAC (more important than context engineering and prompt engineering alone).
2. Move toward building customizable specialized agents for domain-specific problems.
3. Use these seven prompt levels as your guide:
   - start with high-level prompts
   - scale to workflow prompts for repeat success
   - stack capabilities up to template meta prompts

This is how you scale hard and fast into the age of agents.

This is how you become an **agentic engineer**.
