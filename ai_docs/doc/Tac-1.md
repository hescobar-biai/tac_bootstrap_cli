# Tactical Agentic Coding  
## Lesson 1 – Foundations

### Introduction

Welcome to lesson one of **Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC)**.

If you’re here, you’ve realized something critical:

> **AI coding is not enough.**

Engineering has never been just about writing code. This first lesson sets the foundation for a transformation: moving from **Phase 1 (AI Coding)** to an entirely new role in engineering.

If you understand the ideas in this lesson, you’ll maximize the value of Tactical Agentic Coding and prepare yourself for the future of software engineering.

## The Emergence of the Agentic Engineer

In 2023, the domain **agenticengineer.com** was acquired with the prediction that a new role would emerge:

> **An engineer defined by the ability to build systems that can take actions on their behalf.**

That role now exists.

### Phase 1: AI Coding
- Birth of *vibe coders*
- Code becomes fully commoditized
- Faster development using prompts and context
- Anyone can build apps with a single prompt

### Phase 2: Agentic Coding
- Engineers reclaim leverage
- Codebases become **self-operating machines**
- Engineers move up the stack again

---

## The Mission of Tactical Agentic Coding

**Transform you into an engineer they can’t replace.**

“They” includes:
- Your boss  
- Your company  
- Your industry  
- AI itself  

No job is permanent. Skills decay. Evolution is mandatory.

---

## The Strategy: Move Up the Stack

In a world where code is a commodity:

- We stop competing on typing speed
- We stop competing on syntax knowledge
- We **become commanders of compute**

Engineering is not prompting for code.

Engineering is:
> **Using compute to build systems that build systems.**

---

## What Engineering Has Always Been

Engineering was never about writing code.

It is about:
- Building systems of leverage
- Producing valuable outcomes
- Maximizing impact with minimal effort

Agentic engineers invest time in:
- Planning
- Reviewing
- Designing closed-loop systems

---

## Course Structure

This course consists of **8 lessons**, each introducing:

- One critical **agentic coding tactic**
- A reference **codebase**
- A **loot box** with:
  - Prompts
  - Commands
  - Links
  - Tools
  - Ideas

The **tactic** is the most important part of each lesson.

If you understand each tactic, you win in **Phase 2 of the Generative AI era**.

---

## The Goal: Irreplaceable Leverage

Every software revolution creates an opportunity to become a **10x engineer**.

Not by working harder—but by achieving leverage.

- 80% of work is noise
- 20% creates exponential impact
- Agentic coding is one of those leverage points

You found TAC.
Now it’s time to commit fully.

---

## The Phase 2 Engineer

The Phase 2 engineer:
- Transforms codebases into self-operating machines
- Automates entire classes of engineering work
- Extracts repeated value from the same effort

This course compresses over a year of work into eight focused lessons.

---

## Tactic #1 – Stop Coding

This is uncomfortable.
It is controversial.
And it is **mission-critical**.

> **Stop coding.**

Your hands and mind are no longer the best tools for writing code.

Powerful language models running agentic loops on supercomputers are now better coders than humans.

You are an **engineer**, not a coder.

### Important Clarification
- Code generation still matters
- Code understanding still matters
- Manual typing does not scale

If you are still typing code by hand, you cannot keep up.

## AI Coding vs Agentic Coding

### AI Coding (Phase 1)
- Context + Model + Prompt
- Generates files
- One-shot execution

### Agentic Coding (Phase 2)
- Context + Model + Prompt + **Tools**
- Executes long chains of actions
- Performs real engineering work

This is the **Core 4**.

---

## The Agentic Prompt

An **agentic prompt**:
- Contains sequences of tool calls
- Executes plans end-to-end
- Can run for minutes or hours
- Works with or without human oversight

Agentic coding is a **superset** of AI coding.

---

## Claude Code as an Agentic Tool

Claude Code combines:
1. A powerful reasoning model
2. Reliable long tool execution chains
3. A robust agent architecture

This unlocks:
- Long-running workflows
- Self-updating codebases
- Automated engineering processes

---

## Programmable Agentic Coding

Claude Code is **programmable**.

It can be invoked from:
- Shell scripts
- TypeScript (Bun)
- Python (Astral UV)

This enables:
- Systems that trigger agents
- Agents embedded in the SDLC
- Engineering without constant human presence

> **We are building systems that build systems.**

---

## Why This Changes Everything

Because Claude Code:
- Runs in the terminal
- Integrates with developer environments
- Can operate autonomously
- Can be embedded directly into codebases

This allows:
- Agentic triggers
- Autonomous workflows
- Continuous engineering leverage

---

## The Core Truth

To become an irreplaceable engineer:

> **You will replace yourself.**

This is the paradox of agentic coding.

Vibe coders cannot replicate this.
This is where real leverage lives.

---

## Final Takeaway

Agentic coding is not about writing code.

It is about:
- Designing leverage
- Scaling impact
- Automating intelligence
- Owning the future of engineering

Next lesson:
> **Leverage points that turn 10 minutes of your work into 60+ minutes of output.**

See you in **Lesson 2**.
